# Homework-3

I created a function with a for() loop called avg_test that used the SemesterGrades function and allowed the user to specify the number of tests. It randomly sampled the num_tests through the SemesterGrades function and saved it as my_test then took the average of my_test.By have avg_test, this allowed me to test it in a for() loop for 3 tests and 12 tests and just change the num_tests accordingly and compare the stats and distributions. 


When running the summary function for an average of 3 tests compared to an average of 12 tests, 3 tests had an overall lower minimum score and a slightly lower median and mean. Sometimes the mean of 3 tests would be higher but only by a point or less. The max score was always higher but the standard deviation was larger. When running the histogram it was slightly left skewed and had a wider range/spread. 

With an average of 12 tests, the mean and median were slightly higher for most samples. It always had a higher minimum value, but a lower maximum value than 3 tests. It is unimodal and bell shaped with a low standard deviation. 


I would rather have 3 tests rather than 12. The mean and median were very similar and often times the same. The maximum score for three tests was always higher than 12, but there is a lower minimum score however the distribution is left skewed so there will be many more higher averages then there will be of the low and close to that minimum score. The 3 tests also had scores between 90-100 whereas the 12 has a max of 90.80. While there is more spread, the averages were the same and I prefer the left skewness of the 3 tests and having the ability to score higher and have a higher maximum.
